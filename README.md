Class Assignment basic demo website

Just a basic website to mark the start of my HTML / Web Design journey. Who knows where it'll go, but my HTML is actually starting to look good and hey I used <div>'s now so that's neat i guess.
  
  Just download the .zip and unpack it into a folder, once that's done just open Homepage.html and it will work.
