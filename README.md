Class Assignment basic demo website

Just a basic website to mark the start of my HTML / Web Design journey. Who knows where it'll go, but my HTML (and php) is actually starting to look good and hey I used div's now so that's neat i guess.
  
  Just download the .zip and unpack it into a folder, once that's done just open Homepage.php and it will work. 


Update 2:

- Used to update the basis of the website's organization. Added hyperlinks to top of page to navigate pages, rather than bottom.

Update 3

- Major update, changed from html to .php files. Added in-progress login tool. Only works if PhpMyAdmin or some other database is installed and setup properly on a local server (or webserver, if you want to fiddle with the code.)
